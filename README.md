# Fog test

Test for Exponential Height Fog issue

On both standard UE5.4.1 and Oculus fork 5.4.2 exponential height fog is broken and displays differently in each eye.
This was fine in UE5.3.2

Rotate/look around in all directions at the horizon and half of the rotation, the stereo rendering is different between eyes.
